<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a senior-year undergraduate student of Computer Science and Technology at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. **[Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/)**, directed by [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

I am recipient of **[Yao Award](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/list-673-1.html) (Recognition Prize)** and School-level Scholarships. My general GPA is 3.95/4.0, ranking 5/76.

My research interest includes reinforcement learning, robotics, and vision. I am now working as a student intern in Professor [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/)'s group at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I work on dexterous manipulation, reinforcement learning, and robotics here. I was also in Professor [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/)'s group at IIIS, working on an RL project.
