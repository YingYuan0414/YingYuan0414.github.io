<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an incoming Robotics PhD student at [CMU Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). I am broadly interested in robot learning, especially RL, imitation learning and their application in robotics. My goal is to develop algorithms for real-world challenges, such as robust and generalizable robot manipulation.

Previously, I obtained Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology from [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I spent my junior year as a research intern at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) advised by [Prof. Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/). I also worked with [Prof. Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/) at [IIIS, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
